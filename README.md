# Future-Gadget-Login
*Laurie Wired 2024 Halloween Programming Challenge*

The admin page of the Future Gadget Labratory Homepage serves as the only barrier between our confidential secrets and nefarious entities.  Daru has devised an ingenious captcha system using existing laboratory technology to not only stop bots from sneaking in, but even non-lab members too!

## Installation üñ•Ô∏è
I've tried to make this process as simple as possible, thus I've zipped up the binary which you can download [here](https://github.com/TechSupportSparky/future-gadget-login/releases/tag/Release). The runtime library has been statically linked so there should be no prerequisite installs!

## Problems installing? üòï
If for any reason there is an issue getting this program to work, I've also provided a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wtIMgLiwVPI) of what it looks like to log into our system.  This can also serve as a walkthrough if anyone gets stuck on how to proceed!

## Credits üôá
